# Shuttle-bus
Using Google Maps API to find the shortest route given multiple stops, a start and an end

THE PLAN:
1. have the map appear with your current location as the center

2. have a form to put in your starting point, end point, and multiple pit stops.    
      - This requires the form to autocomplete (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-addressform)

3. have a marker appear for each place you enter

4. make an algorithim to calculate shortest route between each
      - this requires distance matrix https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/distance-matrix

5. draw out the shortest route on the map and list the places in order
